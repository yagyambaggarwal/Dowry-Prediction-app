This is a toy project where I have used Machine Learning to make a model to predict the Dowry amount based on varying features.
The data was generated from a Deep Learning model.
I further used Flask in the backend and HTML, CSS in the frontend to make the learnings interactive.
It's just a Toy project and I don't confirm any correctness in the result neither I promote dowry in any way, its just an attempt to make the Machine Learning fun and interactive.
This is the video showing the live view of the project. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PmBUNZZnz0Wy213Zx5kq5r6cX69WocP_/view?usp=sharing
